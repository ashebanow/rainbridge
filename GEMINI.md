RainBridge is a simple command line utility to import aindrop.io bookmarks into Karakeep, using the Raindrop API.

API Rate Limiting and Throttling: Handling rate limiting is crucial. You'll want to implement robust error handling and potentially exponential backoff strategies to ensure the batch operations are reliable. You might also consider allowing users to configure the throttling limits.

Authentication: How will users authenticate with the Raindrop.io API? You'll need a secure method for storing API keys or tokens.

Configuration: Think about the user-friendliness of setting up API keys, choosing AI models (if you offer options), and customizing the behavior of the TUI. Command-line arguments, configuration files, or a simple interactive setup wizard could be used.

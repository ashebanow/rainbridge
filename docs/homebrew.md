### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository for Your Tap

1.  **Choose a Name:** The repository name is crucial. It must follow the format `homebrew-<tapname>`. For example, if your GitHub username is `ashebanow`, and you want a tap for your personal projects, you might name it `homebrew-personal`.
    *   **Example:** `ashebanow/homebrew-personal`

2.  **Initialize the Repository:** Create this new repository on GitHub. You can initialize it with a `README.md` and a `.gitignore`.

### Step 2: Create Your Formula File(s)

Inside your newly created tap repository, you'll place your Homebrew formula files.

1.  **Formula Naming:** The formula file should be named after the software it installs, followed by `.rb`. For RainBridge, it would be `rainbridge.rb`.

2.  **Location:** Place the formula file directly in the root of your tap repository.
    *   **Example Structure:**
        ```
        ashebanow/homebrew-personal/
        ├── README.md
        ├── .gitignore
        └── rainbridge.rb  <-- Your formula file goes here
        ```

3.  **Formula Content:** The content of `rainbridge.rb` would be what we generated earlier using `just homebrew-release`. You'd copy the output of that command into this file.

    ```ruby
    # Example content for rainbridge.rb (assuming you ran `just homebrew-release VERSION=0.1.0`)
    class Rainbridge < Formula
      desc "A utility to import bookmarks into Karakeep from Raindrop.io"
      homepage "https://github.com/ashebanow/rainbridge" # Your project's repo
      url "https://github.com/ashebanow/rainbridge/archive/refs/tags/v0.1.0.tar.gz"
      sha256 "YOUR_GENERATED_SHA256_HERE" # This will be generated by the script
      license "MIT"

      depends_on "go"

      def install
        system "go", "build", "-ldflags", "-s -w", "-o", bin/"rainbridge", "./cmd/rainbridge"
      end

      test do
        system bin/"rainbridge", "--version"
      end
    end
    ```

4.  **Commit and Push:** Commit `rainbridge.rb` to your `homebrew-personal` repository and push it to GitHub.

### Step 3: Add Your Tap to Homebrew

Now, on any machine where you want to use your custom formulas, you'll "tap" your repository.

```bash
bew tap <your_github_username>/<tapname>
# For our example:
brew tap ashebanow/personal
```

### Step 4: Install Formulas from Your Tap

Once tapped, you can install formulas from your tap just like any other Homebrew formula:

```bash
brew install <formula_name>
# For RainBridge:
brew install rainbridge
```

### Step 5: Updating Your Formulas

When you release a new version of RainBridge (e.g., `v0.2.0`):

1.  **Tag Your Project:** Make sure you tag your `rainbridge` project's repository (e.g., `ashebanow/rainbridge`) with the new version (e.g., `v0.2.0`).
2.  **Generate New Formula:** Run `just homebrew-release VERSION=0.2.0` again to get the updated `url` and `sha256` for the new version.
3.  **Verify Formula:** Manually inspect the generated `rainbridge.rb` file to ensure its correctness and that the `url` and `sha256` are accurate for the new version.
4.  **Publish Pull Request:** Run `just homebrew-publish-pr VERSION=0.2.0` to automatically create a pull request to your Homebrew tap repository. Review and merge this PR on GitHub.
5.  **Update Homebrew:** Users will then just need to run `brew update` (which updates all taps) and then `brew upgrade rainbridge` (or `brew reinstall rainbridge` if they want to force it).
